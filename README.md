# Facenet: Real-time face recognition using deep learning Tensorflow

## Project

Based on https://github.com/AISangam/Facenet-Real-time-face-recognition-using-deep-learning-Tensorflow repository
Main purpoue is face image classification taken to catalog image galleries

This is completly based on deep learning nueral network and implented using Tensorflow framework. Here you will get how to implement fastly and you can find code at github and uses is demonstrated at YouTube.

## Installation Python Libraries:
- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow (1.4.0)
- Scipy (0.17.0)
- Scikit-learn (0.19.1)
- Opencv (2.4.9.1)
